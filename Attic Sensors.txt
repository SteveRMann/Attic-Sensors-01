I had a lot of problems making the esp boot into normal mode when GPIO2 was not high on startup.
The solution was to use the 2N3904 as a switch, and delay the start of the light sensor module.  
R1C1 holds the base of the transistor low long enough to let the esp module start before the light sensor may provide a low to GPIO2.
